# Support Tickets
This is a web based app, that is used to generate support tickets. I created it using PHP, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
## To run the code
#Use Phpstorm or a text editor of your choice, make sure you have a SQL Server like xammp or wamp or mysql workbench
## Creating the database
#Create a database in your sql server, find the script.sql that I have included in this project, you can locate it in a folder named database
#Once you run the files in your IDE or Text-Editor, navigate to includes/config.php, and edit or remove the database password to suit your settings.
## Using the site
#Launch the project in the browser, your entry point is index.php which hosts the login form. Use the link in the login form to navigate to signup.php
#Create an account and ensure that you populate the fields as hinted by the labels, fr any errors, you will receive more hints as I have added validation
#Once signed in, you will see a page with a table and links to create new receipts, view, update and or delete the receipts.
#Once you are done you can logout.
## Screenshots
#I have added screenshots of how the pages look. To see the screenshots, open a folder named "screenshot".
